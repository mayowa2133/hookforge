  - Auto-captions, caption translation, AI edit style packs, chat-edit apply/undo, editor UI controls, AI job polling API, and end-to-end validation are operational
- [x] Slice 2 transcript engine and editor integration
  - TranscriptSegment model, transcript auto/get/patch APIs (legacy + v2 aliases), in-editor transcript operations, conservative ripple safety, and full gate validation via tsc + pnpm test + test:e2e:slice12
- [x] Phase 3 AI creator stack
  - Web Creator Studio now includes prompt/script generation jobs, actor presets, voice clone + AI Echo onboarding, AI twin onboarding, teleprompter assist, camera capture/upload, and end-to-end AI_CREATOR render path coverage

- [x] Post-Phase 6 enterprise hardening and scale
  - Enterprise hardening delivered with workspace OIDC/SAML APIs, SSO policy enforcement, capability-based guards, immutable AuditEvent stream, scoped API key rotation/rate limits, ops SLO/queue/recovery endpoints, security settings UI, and enterprise e2e coverage
- [-] Descript-first 6-month quality program
  - Program launched with Descript-first interaction model: transcript primary, timeline precision layer, chat plan/apply/undo safety flow, and recording-first path wired through projects-v2 routes
- [x] Phase 1 recording core and ingest reliability
  - Implemented browser recording controls in OpenCut shell, projects-v2 recording session/chunk/finalize/cancel APIs, resumable multipart upload path with fallback registration, auto-transcribe on finalize, dashboard New Recording CTA, and descript-core end-to-end script coverage
